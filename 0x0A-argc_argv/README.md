This is an ALX project on arguments to main(argc, argv)

The files below are what I have created to meet learning objectives for this
project:

0-whatsmyname.c - a program that prints its name, followed by a new line

1-args.c - prints the number of arguments passed into it, followed by a new line

2-args.c - prints all arguments it receives.

3-mul.c - multiplies two numbers.

4-add.c - adds positive numbers and prints result, followed by a new line

100-change.c - prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
