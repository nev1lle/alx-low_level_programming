This is a project folder on Bit Manipulation.

The following learning objectives are to be met by the end of this project:

	1. How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators.
	2. Look for the right source of information without too much help

The files created to meet the above learning objectives include:

	1. 0-binary_to_uint.c - converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
	2. 1-print_binary.c - prints the binary representation of a number.
	3. 2-get_bit.c - returns the value of a bit at a given index.
	4. 3-set_bit.c - sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
	5. 4-clear_bit.c - sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
	6. 5-flip_bits.c - returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
	7. 100-get_endianness.c - checks the endianness.
	8. 101-password - contains the password to this program: https://github.com/alx-tools/0x13.c
