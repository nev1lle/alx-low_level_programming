This is a project on function pointers which seeks to meet the following
learning requirements:

	1. Function pointers and how to use them.
	2. What a function pointer holds exactly.
	3. Where a function pointer points to in the virtual memory.

The following files are created to solve the project's tasks:

	1. 0-print_name.c: prints a name.
	2. 1-array_iterator.c: executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an                                array.
	3. 2-int_index.c: searches for an integer.
	4. 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h: program that
	performs simple operations.
	5. 100-main_opcodes.c: a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
