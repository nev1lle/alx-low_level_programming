This is a project on linked lists that aims to meet the following learning objectives:
	1. When and why using linked lists vs arrays
	2. How to build and use linked lists

The following files are created to solve this project's tasks:
	1. 0-print_list.c - prints all the elements of a list_t list.

	2. 1-list_len.c - returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
	
	3. 2-add_node.c - adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
	
	4. 3-add_node_end.c - adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
	
	5. 4-free_list.c - frees a list_t list.
	
	6. 100-first.c - prints "You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n" before the main function is executed.
	
	7. 101-hello_holberton.asm - a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.
